# Final-Project using Python
This project focuses on text analysis in Python. To preserve the copyright of the question being asked, I will describe what is being asked rather than state it explicitly.

Throughout the file, I do the following:

1) Read and open text files.
2) Extract specific lines with certain titles.
3) Find how many distinct items exist, and check for duplicates.
4) Compare which texts were written by each author.
5) Determined which author wrote longer articles.
6) Ran a logistic linear model based on word counts.
7) Estimated probability of paper ownership.
